# Big-trip

### About project

"Big Trip" is a modern service for real travelers. The service helps to plan a trip route in detail, calculate the cost of travel and get information about attractions. The minimalistic interface will not give you a reason to get distracted and will focus your attention on planning your trip.

The app allows to:

- **create**, **edit** and **delete** events;
- **mark** tasks as favorite;
- **sort** events by Day, Time and Price;
- **filter** events (Everything, Future, Past)
- **see total cost** of the hole trip
